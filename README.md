To run an example of our proposed algorithm, download all the files. 
The matlab file named: main_script.m will run the tumor data from patient patient2.
The script loads the input count data. Alpha is used to control the possible number of subclones that
interpret the input data. Beta can be any integer less than 1000. Variable Rep is the number of times the
user wants the data to be processed.
